after some esearch I decide to migrate whole project to Material Design Components

I use material-ui examples (first blog example) to re write my ui components

Also I use `makeStyles` to create my styles sepparate from UI logic. (all styles are in sepparate folder)

directories in *src/* :
1- assets: all non-logic assets I used in project
2- components: indevidual and indipended peaces of my project like a `Header`
3- pages: project's pages like: `home`, `login`, ...
4- services: any non-UI components: like `userService` and ...
5- styles: all js-styles, scss, ... style codes (I prefere centerilized location for all styles togetter)
   may be I use another aproach later, (like each module(component, page, service, ...) holds their own style logic)
